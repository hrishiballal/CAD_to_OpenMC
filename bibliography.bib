	abstract = {While computer-aided design is a major part of many modern manufacturing pipelines, the design files typically generated describe raw geometry. Lost in this representation is the procedure by which these designs were generated. In this paper, we present a method for reverse-engineering the process by which 3D models may have been generated, in the language of constructive solid geometry ({CSG}). Observing that {CSG} is a formal grammar, we formulate this inverse {CSG} problem as a program synthesis problem. Our solution is an algorithm that couples geometric processing with state-of-the-art program synthesis techniques. In this scheme, geometric processing is used to convert the mixed discrete and continuous domain of {CSG} trees to a pure discrete domain where modern program synthesizers excel. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithm on several different examples, including those with over 100 primitive parts. We show that our algorithm is able to find simple programs which are close to the ground truth, and demonstrate our method's applicability in mesh re-editing. Finally, we compare our method to prior state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that our algorithm dominates previous methods in terms of resulting {CSG} compactness and runtime, and can handle far more complex input meshes than any previous method.},

The structure of the software is described in detail, and various examples are given to showcase the versatility of the {McXtrace} procedure and outline a possible route to using Monte Carlo simulations in data analysis to gain new scientific insights. The studies performed span a range of X-ray experimental techniques: absorption tomography, powder diffraction, single-crystal diffraction and pump-and-probe experiments. Simulation studies are compared with experimental data and theoretical calculations.

	abstract = {This article presents the Monte Carlo simulation package {McXtrace}, intended for optimizing X-ray beam instrumentation and performing virtual X-ray experiments for data analysis. The system shares a structure and code base with the popular neutron simulation code {McStas} and is a good complement to the standard X-ray simulation software {SHADOW}. {McXtrace} is open source, licensed under the General Public License, and does not require the user to have access to any proprietary software for its operation. The structure of the software is described in detail, and various examples are given to showcase the versatility of the {McXtrace} procedure and outline a possible route to using Monte Carlo simulations in data analysis to gain new scientific insights. The studies performed span a range of X-ray experimental techniques: absorption tomography, powder diffraction, single-crystal diffraction and pump-and-probe experiments. Simulation studies are compared with experimental data and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the simulation capabilities for computing coherent X-ray beam properties and a comparison with basic diffraction theory are presented.},

The aim of this paper is to discuss this vast research domain and to single out the Molten Salt Reactor configurations that deserve further evaluation.},

	abstract = {We have developed a novel hierarchical data structure for the efficient representation of sparse, time-varying volumetric data discretized on a 3D grid. Our “{VDB}”, so named because it is a Volumetric, Dynamic grid that shares several characteristics with B+trees, exploits spatial coherency of time-varying data to separately and compactly encode data values and grid topology. {VDB} models a virtually infinite 3D index space that allows for cache-coherent and fast data access into sparse volumes of high resolution. It imposes no topology restrictions on the sparsity of the volumetric data, and it supports fast (average
              O
              (1)) random access patterns when the data are inserted, retrieved, or deleted. This is in contrast to most existing sparse volumetric data structures, which assume either static or manifold topology and require specific data access patterns to compensate for slow random access. Since the {VDB} data structure is fundamentally hierarchical, it also facilitates adaptive grid sampling, and the inherent acceleration structure leads to fast algorithms that are well-suited for simulations. As such, {VDB} has proven useful for several applications that call for large, sparse, animated volumes, for example, level set dynamics and cloud modeling. In this article, we showcase some of these algorithms and compare {VDB} with existing, state-of-the-art data structures.},

The system shares a structure and code base with the popular neutron simulation code {McStas} and is a good complement to the standard X-ray simulation software {SHADOW}. {McXtrace} is open source, licensed under the General Public License, and does not require the user to have access to any proprietary software for its operation. The structure of the software is described in detail, and various examples are given to showcase the versatility of the {McXtrace} procedure and outline a possible route to using Monte Carlo simulations in data analysis to gain new scientific insights. The studies performed span a range of X-ray experimental techniques: absorption tomography, powder diffraction, single-crystal diffraction and pump-and-probe experiments. Simulation studies are compared with experimental data and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the simulation capabilities for computing coherent X-ray beam properties and a comparison with basic diffraction theory are presented.},
